In fact, since 2013 we've never needed to advertise. The first two community members were referrals from friends who were in tech and knew their kids needed to learn it. Since then, SKILSTAK has helped thousands to accomplish their learning and career goals.</p> <p>Here's how one company representative described it in an email after hiring a community member with a 100,000 dollar starting salary:</p> <p>Clearly, you have a talent for educating people in tech. ... After [your member's] success [here], I suspect the review team will be even more interested in picking up one or two of your students. We've had a lot of very bright interns from some of the top universities in the country and [your community member] was right in the mix with the best of them.</p> <p>Rob met this person at a Linux meetup and introduced them to our community members.</p> <p>How to get a job?</p> <p>We talk about this a lot in the Boost. Getting hired is about building trust with potential employers by producing demonstratable, unique proof that you can produce what that company needs. We help people do it all the time.</p> <p>Since SKILSTAK is largely a labor of love we maintain a collection of nice things people have said over the years.</p> <p>Want to add your own nice comment?</p> <p>We love when people are helped.

This is particularly hard to do for overworked industry professionals who frequently are let go only to realize they cannot get another job because they have not managed and maintained their \"skilstak\" at all</p> <p>Would you go to a doctor that didn't keep up?</p> <p>Ever notice that doctors and dentists (and healthcare professionals like them) must keep with the latest procedures? They have at least as much to keep up with as a modern technology professional, yet we don't demand the same standard from tech professionals.</p> <p>Why? Probaby because people are less likely to die. But with the latest security incidents and the demand for Security Analysts increasing 35% per year people probably will start dying from tech pro failures. How about all the hospitals shut down completely during the pandemic because of poor security? How many people indirectly died because of it that we'll never know?</p> <p>Bottom line: it's far past time to require the same high standards from technology professionals that we do from our health care professionals.</p> <p>The term \"stack\" is frequently used in technology circles to refer to a collection of technologies that work well together. \"Do you use ELK or EFK stack?\" one might ask. Stacks frequently have acronyms associated with them (MERN, MEAN, LAMP, etc.) but not always.</p> <p>Picking what \"stack\" of \"skills\" you want to learn and maintain, therefore, has a direct corralary to the term SKILSTAK, as in, \"What your skill stack?\" Arguably, people usually say \"skill set\" instead, which is synonymous.</p>"},{"location":"#unbound-from-accreditation-lag-and-lies","title":"Unbound from accreditation lag and lies","text":"<p>All \"accredited\" organizations must submit their curriculum (and any change to it) to an accreditation agency to which they pay a large some of money to ensure their curriculum is sound and current. The problem is that the process can take up to a year. Executives in the education industry have frequently commented on how this inhibits innovation in the learning material itself. Considering that in a given year, perhaps three major revisions to employable best practices can happen there is simply no way such \"accredited\" institutions can ever keep up. Hell, people working in tech every day can't even keep up themselves. The pace is just that fast and only getting faster.</p> <p>Never count on any \"accredited\" institution to be able to teach you anything that will distinguish you from the mass of other out-of-date potential new hires. Your skills will be as dusty as the books in the back of their libraries and just as useless. Instead, you must learn to manage your own learning in a way that is free from institutional dependency. Just ask any successful person you trust working in tech today. They'll confirm it. Those institutions spend tons of money on marketing and lies convincing you to give them your money unnecessarily. They feed on it like a vampire does the blood of the naive innocent.</p> <p>Sometimes you do need a piece of paper, but more often than not you don't. We'll help you learn how to make that decision confidently for yourself. You are in control, not them.</p>"},{"location":"#free-from-corporate-bias","title":"Free from corporate bias","text":"<p>Some corporations have donated so much money to educational institutions that those running the corporation dictate the selection of technologies and learning offerings of what is suppose to be an independent educational organization responding to the needs of those paying money to learn from them. Some \"schools\" even accept cash \"endowments\" from these corporations while claiming it has no influence over their curriculum.</p> <p>Coincidence?</p> <p>Ever notice how most community colleges only teach networking on Cisco hardware? Or that colleges in towns dominated by the banking industry prefer to teach Java (which most banks fundamentally depend on) over other, more modern languages?</p> <p>Some corporations are so desperate to get people to learn their tech so they can sell that tech to others companies with big-pockets claiming it has \"wide adoption and developer support\" that they will \"give away\" education \"for free\" while hiding their agenda.</p> <p>Look deeper for yourself and you will see that greed dominates the world of traditional education and \"training\" and probably always will.</p> <p>Rest assured, that silliness will never happen at SKILSTAK. Decisions about which technology to invest in are always based on the needs and goals of the individual. Multiple community members, employed full-time by different and diverse companies provide a balanced voice and honest recommendations based on partial but informed opinions about what is best and most relevant to learn.

But also for the free conversations and teachings you\n    are providing on YouTube.  I agree 100% with your comments about\n    Facebook and Google and think your knowledge projects are\n    fascinating.  But I also identity with your recent wisdom  about\n    mentoring and teaching.  I am 45 years old, graduated with a CS\n    degree in 2002, but because of various reasons I did not do well in\n    college and didn\u2019t pursue programming until about 6 years ago.\n    Through that pursuit I found a job which lead to a second job which\n    had me working on projects with zero documentation with languages\n    I did not know.   I struggled but eventually figured out what\n    I needed to get the work done, fix bugs, and add features.  That was\n    until I burned out February of last year.  Since then I\u2019ve been on\n    my own path of self learning and healing.\n\n    So when I first heard you talk about what an autodidact was\n    I realized that I\u2019ve already been doing that because I\u2019ve had too.\n    And that I am being one now.

The result is simplified content that doesn't go into unnecessary rabbit holes. For example, a machine learning engineer or student using an assigned Linux user account never needs to understand how to create, modify, and delete users and groups on the system.

If they take too long they won't be moving fast enough to catch it, too fast and they might overshoot it. When the wave crests the surfer can then stand on the board and ride it to glory before hopping off and paddling back out to sea to watch for the next one.</p> <p>Such is the life of a good technologist. Paddling equates to learning the technology as it forms and producing proof you have mastered it. Standing up on the board is like landing a lucritive tech job having prepared in advance and being one of only a few who can demonstrate mastery. Surfers wipe out, miss waves, or, on occasion, have sharks take bites out of them. Surfing is inherently risky and demands constant focus and fitness. Those who opt for tech careers commit to a similar lifestyle with its constant learning demands and very real risks. Tech jobs are not for everyone, but for many the continual challenge is exactly what they crave.</p>"},{"location":"boost/faq/#what-is-needed-to-participate","title":"What is needed to participate?","text":"<p>Boosts are always free (although donations, subs, and tips are appreciated and motivating).
