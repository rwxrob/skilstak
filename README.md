This repo contains the knowledge base for the SKILSTAK Learning Community founded by Rob Muhlestein (rwxrob). Feel free to create PRs and issues to suggest changes and corrections. All contributions become the property of SKILSTAK in order to ensure content remains open. The content of this repo is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 4.0 International license](LICENSE) meaning that it can be copied freely for any use but must remain exactly as it is here if and when distributed (which is easily facilitated by it being a git repo). Any change must never be distributed (including public forks). This is to prevent content from being abused, misrepresented, and taken out of context and ensures that consumers always know the origin and source for future updates (which is critical given the dynamic nature of this content).
